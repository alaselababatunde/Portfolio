# NLP-and-Transformers-Learning-Code
# NLP & Transformers ‚Äì Learning Projects

Welcome! This repository contains code I wrote while learning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Transformers**, based on a course taught by **Hugging Face**.

These projects explore core NLP concepts and Transformer-based models using tools from the Hugging Face `transformers` library, PyTorch, and other open-source frameworks.

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside

- Tokenization and preprocessing
- Text classification with BERT
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Question Answering models
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Working with Hugging Face Datasets and Tokenizers

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Datasets
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
